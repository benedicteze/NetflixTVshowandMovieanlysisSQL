# Netflix TV shows and Movies analysis SQL
This data set was obtained for Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/netflix-tv-shows-and-movies) and analyzed to find interesting facts. 
Using SQL I placed emphasis on TV shows and movies released in the last decade (2012- 2022). Below are the questions I sought to answer. 
1. How many movies and shows were released in the last decade?
2. What is the average runtime for movies and shows rounded to the nearest whole?
3. Which movie/show had the highest IMDB and TMDB score in the last decade (2022-2012)?
4. Behind every good movie there is an actor(s) who contributed to these high-charting movies and shows who are these actors?

# Takeaway
1. There were more movies released in the last decade as compared to shows.  
2. Regardless of TV shows having multiple seasons it still had a lesser average runtime when compared to movies. 
3. IMDB and TMDB scores are both measures of a movie or show performance. Seventy-four movies and shows did well in the last decade.  

# Objective
This exercise was done to show what I have learnt using MySQL. 
1. Creating tables (the data could have been imported). 
2. Insert data into the table. 
3. Perform analysis (using JOINS and analytical thinking).
